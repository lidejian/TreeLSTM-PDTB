# TagNN-PDTB

This repo contains the code for a state-of-the-art discourse relation classifier, trained and tested on [PDTB V2](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T05).

Here We implemented the Tree-LSTM and Tree-GRU models and enhanced them with pos-tag information. You can find more details in our paper at IJCNLP 2017: [Tag-Enhanced Tree-Structured Neural Networks for Implicit Discourse Relation ClassiÔ¨Åcation](https://eastonwang.github.io/papers/tag_nn_pdtb_2017.pdf).

## Data

We trained and and tested our models on [PDTB V2](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T05) dataset. You should download them and convert the PDTB into a "pipe" delimited file using the built-in tool in the dataset. 

## Usage
To run the program, you can use the following command for preprocessing the data, prepare the formatted dataset and train the models:

```
python main.py [--preprocess] [--prepare] [--train]
```

For detailed usage, run `python main.py -h` to see the list of options.
